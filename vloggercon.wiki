§ Vloggercon

⸺ by Charles Iliya Krempeaux

**Vloggercon** was conference for those involved in (the then nascent) **video and TV on the Internet**.

The official website for **vloggercon** is: http:/((/))vloggercon.com/.

§§ Vloggercon 2006

I attended **Vloggercon 2006**.
(My brother came with me.)

**Vloggercon 2006**  was held on **June 10th** & **June 11th** in **San Francisco** at the **Swedish American Hall** ''(1)''.

After the last day of Vloggercon, some of the attendees went to **The Mint Karaoke Lounge** ''(2)'' to hang out and sing.
(I wasn't there, I had to catch a plane before the conference was even over.)
Some videos of the fun can be seen at: Vloggeraoke ''(3)''.
